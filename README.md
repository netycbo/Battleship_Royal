# Project Goals and Stages

This is my version of the classic, well-known Battleship game. 
When the project is ready, users will be able to play against the computer on three levels of difficulty or play against other users. Users will be able to check their own statistics and communicate with others through live chat.

This project is still in development mode. My goals to achieve with this project are to learn Blazor SSR, SignalR, state management, CSS, and Bootstrap. I divided the process into 3 stages.

### Stages

- **Stage 1**:  Build the backend based on Entity Framework and ASP.NET Core - ✅
- **Stage 2**:  Build the UI with Blazor SSR - 🚧
- **Stage 3**:  Add SignalR for Player vs Player mode and chat between players - 🚧
